# Day One

## Part One

Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.

Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

## Part Two

The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation.
They offer you a second one if you can find three numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.
